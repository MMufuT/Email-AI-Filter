# Email AI Filter
## Overview
Email AI Filter is a powerful email filtering tool designed to make your inbox smarter and more efficient. By harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI embeddings and the Qdrant vector database, it offers context-based email search, allowing you to find and organize your emails with unprecedented accuracy.

## Features
- Context-Based Email Search: Contrary to the noram Gmail keyword-based filtering, Email AI Filter leverages OpenAI embeddings to understand the content and context of your emails, ensuring that your search results are relevant to your query.

- [Cosine Similarity Search](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search/): The heart of our search mechanism is cosine similarity, a mathematical concept that measures the similarity between two vectors. It forms the foundation of our search functionality, ensuring the most relevant emails are presented to you.
